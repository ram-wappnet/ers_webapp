## 5 Installation And Project Execution/Usage Steps
### Cloning the Repository

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
    ```sh
    git clone git@git.wappnet.us:akshay-wappnet/ERS-Admin.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd ERS-Admin
    ```

### Environment Configuration

This project contains 2 environments. The environment configuration files are stored in a `config` folder, which is ignored in Git. You need to download this folder from Google Drive and place it in your project directory.

1. Download the `config` folder from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18p_SWgJY30VQfwlP31hc2pAzEFYRbEqn/view?usp=sharing).
2. Extract the `config` folder into the lib directory.
```
save_a_plate_restaurant/
|- android
|- ios
|- lib
    |- config/
    |- main.dart
|- test
```
3. Ensure the `config` folder is added to your `.gitignore` file to avoid uploading it to the repository.

### Installing Dependencies

Install the required dependencies by running:
```sh
flutter pub get
```

#### Creating launch configurations in VSCode to run app without command ðŸš€



Luckily, both of these are easily fixable with a launch.json file. At the root of our project, create a launch.json file inside a folder called .vscode.

```sh
// .vscode/launch.json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "ERS DEVELOPMENT",
            "request": "launch",
            "type": "dart",
            "args": [
                "--dart-define",
                "ENVIRONMENT=DEVELOPMENT"
            ],
            "flutterMode": "debug",
            "noDebug": true //when noDebug is true run without debugging when noDebug is false run with debugging
        },
        {
            "name": "ERS PRODUCTION",
            "request": "launch",
            "type": "dart",
            "args": [
                "--dart-define",
                "ENVIRONMENT=PRODUCTION"
            ],
            "flutterMode": "debug",
            "noDebug": true //when noDebug is true run without debugging when noDebug is false run with debugging
        },
